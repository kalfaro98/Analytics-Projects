Below I will explain the steps I took to create the bike sales dashboard

Step 1: From the raw excel data set I had, I first cleaned up the data by removing duplicates, making sure capitalization was the same throughout, removed any additional spacing in words using the "Trim" function. 

Step 2: I then created pivot tables and charts along with them to demonstrate the relationships between different variables. For example, I was able to look at the average income of males and females who purchased bikes, and those who did not. This was paired with tables showing age groups, and their commute distance. 

Step 3: Lastly, I incorporated all of the pivot tables and charts to create a dashboard, along with filtering to allow the user to choose the relationships they wish to view. For example, I was able to filter the bike sales from males and females in accordance to the region they lived in, their marital status, and education level.
